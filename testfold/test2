You may choose to work with up to two other student if you wish. Only one submission is required per group, please ensure that both group members names are on the submitted copy. Work must be submitted electronically via github.com. You are expected to re-register your group using the same method as programming assignment 1. The choice of programming language is yours, but your software will be expected to operate in an environment of my choosing, specifically an arch linux virtual machine.
